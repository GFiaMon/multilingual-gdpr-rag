# Sample questions for the GDPR Compliance Assistant

Designed to test both ZDH crafts guidelines and BITKOM AI data protection sources:

**These questions test**:

- Distinguished between educational vs commercial use cases
- Incorporated AI Act considerations where relevant
- Made scenarios more realistic for actual business/developer dilemmas
